# Installing Quarto and LateX  {#sec-install-lat}

Installing Quarto on your computer is pretty straight forward and should be painless.
If you're getting started with Quarto we suggest that you use RStudio but of course RStudio is not required and there are other options available.
You will also need to install some additional software if you want to render your Quarto documents to PDF format.

This guide assumes you have already installed [R][r-proj] and an IDE ([RStudio IDE][rstudio] or [VSCode][vscode]).
An IDE is not required but recommended, because it makes it easier to work with Quarto.
If you don't have RStudio IDE installed, you will also have to install [Pandoc][pandoc].
If you have RStudio installed there is no need to install Pandoc separately because it's bundled with RStudio.

Next you need to install [Quarto][quarto-install]. It is really straightforward, just download and install from the files specific to your OS (Windows, Mac or linux).

You should also install the `quarto` :package: package using:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("quarto", dep = TRUE)
```

The `dep = TRUE` argument will also install a bunch of additional R packages on which the `quarto` :package: depends.

Finally you can install the `rmarkdown` :package: package but it is not strictly required if using Quarto.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("rmarkdown", dep = TRUE)
```


  
If you want to generate PDF output, you will need to install {{< latex >}}.
For R Markdown users who have not installed {{< latex >}} before, we recommend that you install [TinyTeX][tinytex].
You can install TinyTex from within R using the `tinytex` :package: package with the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex() # install TinyTeX
```

TinyTeX is a lightweight, portable, cross-platform, and easy-to-maintain {{< latex >}} distribution.
The R companion package `tinytex` :package: can help you automatically install missing {{< latex >}} packages when compiling {{< latex >}} or R Markdown documents to PDF.

## MS Windows

An alternative option would be to install MiKTeX instead.
You can download the latest distribution of [MiKTeX][miktex].
Installing MiKTeX is pretty straight forward, but it can sometimes be a pain to get it to play nicely with RStudio.
If at all possible we recommend that you use TinyTex.

## Mac OSX

If for some reason TinyTeX does not work on your Mac computer then you can try to install MacTeX instead.
You can download the latest version of [MacTeX here][mactex].

## Linux

An alternative to TinyTex on linux would be to use a full fledge distribution of {{< latex >}} such as [TexLive][texlive]
