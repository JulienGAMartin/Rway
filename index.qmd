Book in development. Several sections not developed yet
:::

## The aim of this book {.unnumbered}

The aim of this book is two-fold:

1.  introduce you to R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment
    for statistical computing and research.
2.  introduce you to (or reacquaint you with) statistical analysis done
    in R.

R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new
language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be steep
and somewhat daunting. It is not intended to cover everything (neither
with R not with statistics) but simply to help you climb the initial
learning curve (potentially faster) and provide you with the basic
skills (and confidence!) needed to start your own journey with R and
with specific analysis.

## Multilingual book

The book is provided as a multilingual book breaking that language
barrier and potentially allow to facilitate the learn of R and its
mainly english-speaking environment. We are always looking for
volunteers to help developed the book further and add more languages to
the growing list. Please [contact us][whoarewe] if you want to help

On the web version of the book, use {{< fa regular flag >}} in the
navigation bar to switch from one language to another. After switching
to your preferred language, you can of course also download the pdf and
epub versions in this language if you want to using {{< fa download >}}.

List of languages:

- english (work in progresspublish but need polishing)
- french (in development, waiting for english to be polished)
- spanish (one day maybe)
- ... volunteers for more ??

## How to use this book {.unnumbered}

```{=html}
<!-- bootstrap icons works with 
bi body-text
bi search
bi toggle-off
bi github
but useless for pdf
-->
```
For the best experience we recommend that you read the web version of
this book which you can find <https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R/en>.

The web version includes a navbar at the top of the page where you can
toggle the sidebars on and off {{< fa align-left >}}, search through the
book {{< fa search >}}, change the page color {{< fa toggle-off >}} and
suggest revisions if you spot a typo or mistake
{{< fa brands github >}}. You can also download {{< fa download >}} a
pdf and epub versions of the book.

We use a few typographical conventions throughout this book.

R code and the resulting output are presented in code blocks in our
book.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
2 + 2
```

Functions in the text are shown with brackets at the end using code
font, i.e. `mean()` or `sd()` etc.

Objects are shown using code font without the round brackets, i.e.
`obj1`, `obj2` etc.

R packages in the text are shown using code font and followed by the
:package: icon, i.e. `tidyverse` :package:.

A series of actions required to access menu commands in RStudio or
VSCode are identified as `File` -\> `New File` -\> `R Script` which
translates to 'click on the File menu, then click on New File and then
select R Script'.

When we refer to **IDE** (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment
software) later in the text we mean either RStudio of VScode.

When we refer to **.\[Rq\]md**, we mean either R markdown (.Rmd) or
Quarto (.qmd) documents and would generally talk of R markdown documents
when referring to either `.Rmd` or `.qmd` files.

The manual tries to highlight some part of the text using the following
boxes and icons.

## Thanks {.unnumbered}

The first part of the book on using R started as a fork on github from the excellent
[An introduction to R](https://intro2r.com/) book by Douglas, Roos, Mancini,
Couto and Lusseau [@douglas2023]. It was forked on April 23rd, 2023 from
[Alexd106 github repository](https://github.com/alexd106/Rbook) then
modified and updated following my own needs and teaching perspective of
R. The content was neither reviewed nor endorsed by any the previous
developers.

Several parts in the book were based on previous lab manuals for biostatistics classes at uOttawa written by
Martin, Findlay, Morin and Rundle.

Site that provided a lot of information for the book:

- [dplyr introduction](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html)
- [Introduction to gam](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/)
- [Intoduction to gams by Noam Ross](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/)
